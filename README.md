# ds_project
Predictive modeling for Ammonia Refrigeration System

## Please refer to the ds-project jupyter notebook for the project! There is commentary along with the code and results. The other .py files are the class modules to save and load the two models shown in the project.

## The other two are the models themselves, for the purpose of showing the results. 
Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project, and I look forward to discuss the results.
